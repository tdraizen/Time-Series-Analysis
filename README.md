***Time Series Forecasting on Yen Futures utilizing models to test predicted returns and model validation

**Decomposition using a Hodrick-Prescott Filter.

**Forecasting Returns using an ARMA Model.

**Forecasting the Settle Price using an ARIMA Model.

**Forecasting Volatility with GARCH.

**Train Test Validation


Looking at the Plot of Returns (In-Sample) and Predicted Returns(Out-of-Sample) - there does appear to be relationship which from a visual persepctive is a good sign.

The RMSE for the Out of Sample is .41521 vs. the y_test Standard Dev of .4157 which is also encouraging. In addition the RMSE Out vs In Sample was fairly close as well.

My conlcusion is that this is a good model that can predict the future returns on a 1 day lag with a fair degree of accuracy.
